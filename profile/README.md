**Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) is a system of codes for unambiguously representing measurement units.**

The Health Data Standards unit at Regenstrief maintains the UCUM database and supporting documentation, processes submissions and edits to the content, develops and curates accessory content, and coordinates UCUM releases. In addition, Regenstrief continues to cultivate the UCUM community worldwide.

This development work is done in close collaboration with the UCUM Committee of advisors.
